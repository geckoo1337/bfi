This is a sample BrainF*ck interpreter with some examples. 

BrainF*ck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully *Turing complete*, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. How it works ? Take a look at the Wiki page below :
